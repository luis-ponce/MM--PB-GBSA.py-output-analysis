# MM--PB-GBSA.py-output-analysis
The scripts process the output of MMPBSA.py results (both the per-residue and the pairwise decomposition) for several replicates of MD simulations.
The scripts return the plots for each comparison.
Several details must be provided such as the local adress of the ouput, the number of residues and the starting number of residues of each pdb file.....
